Ruby is great. And there are a lot of reasons why. From the very beginning of my coding experience here at Flatiron, I could tell that it is a programming language super friendly to new users, like me. Okay, maybe I thought this at that time because the Learn lessons and videos hammered that idea into my head. Still, looking back I know my transition into the world of coding was smooth, thanks to Ruby. But beyond being constructed in a way that is logical and makes sense to users, programmers that use Ruby love it for so many other reasons: it is super resourceful!

What do I mean? Ever heard of a gem? No, not a precious or semiprecious stone that is cut and polished or engraved. I mean. I mean a Ruby (language) gem, or library of code. To elaborate, a gem is a library of code with specific functionalities that allow ruby to expand its use as a platform for building apps. Ruby comes with all sorts of cool, helpful and neat gems ranging from authentication and security to processing and testing. These Ruby gems are super important and I haven't done much coding in Ruby without the aid of at least one gem. 

Although I might not have known it at the time, from my very first labs in Flatiron's Fullstack Web Development program, I was benefitting from the valuable RSpec. RSpec is a testing tool written in Ruby to test Ruby code. RSpec lies at the very core of test-driven programming, a highly encouraged form of programming that I have definitely made use from. 

The farther into Ruby I get, the more expansive Ruby's gems become. It seems like for every new concept I learn, there's an accompanying Ruby gem to help make my life simpler. I could definitely get used to it!
