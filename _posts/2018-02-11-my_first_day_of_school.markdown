I spent much of my college career with my head stuck in my history books. I love history for a number of reasons. Learning about some of the world's many societies and personalities has helped me gain insight into the desires, customs and cultures of communities beyond the ones I have been exposed to in my American upbringing. To a large-degree, my fascination with history stems from an interest in understanding how the world got to where it is today. As I near the end of my college career, though, I have started, slowly, to pick up my head from my books and begun looking into the future.

When I look into the futures some of the words that loom largest include "coding", "software", and "programming." But what is coding? What is software? What is programming? I took courses of many kinds throughout college: history, psychology, math, economics, foreign language, literature,  and more, but I never took a course in compute science. So unlike many of my peers here at school, I actually don't know the answers to those questions. But I do know that the future lies with the answer to those questions. And just as I am interested in learning about how the world got to the present, I am curious to see where the world is going because I want to be able to be engaged with the future. That's why I am learning how to code. As we progress further into the 21st century, coding and software programming become more integral to our development. I don't want to sit and watch as others take us into the future. I want to be a part of the future. 

I hope you join me as I embark upon my journey into the 21st century and beyond.
