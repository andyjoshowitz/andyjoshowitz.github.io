I am wrapping up my final project and couldn't be more excited. As a student of History, I am a firm believer in the importance of reflection. Upon reflection, I realize I have come a long way. Before enrolling in Flatiron, the only coding exposure I had was in an R-based statistics course that I dropped a few weeks into the semester. Now I am a full-stack web-developer! Pretty cool. 

To prove how well integrated I am into the software development field, my last project was designed to help improve teamwork! The idea was inspired by a semester-long project my college roommate worked on. During junior year, he enrolled in a course for which he had to design the front end and back end of a web-app. Him and his team were creating a web-app kind of likestack exchange. It had a lot of moving parts and required a lot of job-delegation. Good team management became key. 

Enter my group manager web-app. 

It was created to help a team of programmers add projects and keep track of task assignment. It also allows students to ask teammates for help if needed. 

New projects can be submitted and then added as objects to rails via through Redux. Users can then scroll through the list, starting with the most recent submissions, and can see what work is being done. 

I added an admin feature that allows only users who are designated as admins to delete any report.

I used React for better user front-end experience. I allowed users to flag certain projects as needing help etc. The app displays those separately for better readibility. 

Of course I am still early in my coding career and have much to learn still. While I can't claim to be a master at that,  maybe, after this project, I can be deemed a master co...llaberator.
