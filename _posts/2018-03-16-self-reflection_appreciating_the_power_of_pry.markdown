My journey through Object Oriented Ruby made me realize that the secrets to being a good coder and a good person are not too different from eachother. 

One of the traits I most value in people is their level of self-awareness. If you ask me, a self-aware person is a genuine person. And who doesnt want to be around genuine people?

As it turns out, I am on the same page as Object Oriented languages like Ruby.  In Ruby, I learned all about Classes and bringing its objects to life. Classes have attributes and methods that are shared by its Objects. Ruby allows for programmers to refer to an Object as 'self.' Of course, referring to an object as 'self' can be a tricky business. At any given point the object referred to by the word 'self' can change. This forces programmers to stay on top of their code. You always have to know your objects in order to excute properly. I find that outside of the text-editors and shells in which we run our programs, it's important to always know your own 'self.'

Like I would in any experience, coding in Flatiron has helped me learn a lot about myself. 

Furthermore, it is equally as important to debug your code as it is to debug your character flaws.

During my journey through this unit, I have become clsoely acquainted with 'pry', a tool useful for "prying" into your code to debug. Pry is an important tool to utilize for anyone who wants to be an efficient and effective programmer. it affords programmers with easy access into the inner-workings of some code. 

Mastering tools like 'pry' or syntax like 'self' are not only tools to utilized by programmers writing code but for anyone looking to fix their own bugs.
