Just when you think the magic of rails can't be one-upped, Javascript shows up and steals the show.  Rails was a great tool for backend development. Building my rails app was no walk in the park for me. Still, I can hardly imagine how tedious it would have been were it not for rails.  Javascript enhances the magic of app development. While Rail helped for (relatively) easy backend development, Javascript took the front-end experience up a notch. It is the face to Rails' brain, as it were. 

Just like a human body can't function without the brain, though, backend construction is best served when its development is accompanied by simultaneous frontend building. Although the structure of the third and fourth projects for the fullstack web development program was educationally productive (I found), the idea of building the backend and only then considering the frontend seems inefficient. In the future, I would definitely try to integrate frontend considerations into my backend development.
