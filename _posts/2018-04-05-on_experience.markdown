Well, I've completed my second project here at Flatiron. I have to say: this project wasn't so bad! Don't get me wrong, the project challenged me considerably. I was not much better prepared for this one than I was the first project. But still, I had a much better experience this time around. 

But why? 

The answer, I think, is that experience counts. Having gone through the growing pains of the first project definitely made me better able to take on this project for a few key reasons. For starters, I was able to better manager my expectations. When I set out to plan my first project, I greatly underestimated the amount of time and effort I would need to put into the project. As a result, I felt slightly frustrated when I realized that the project would take much more effort and time than I anticipated. That's not to say I didn't feel frustrated at all this time around. I definitely had those moments. But overall those moments were fewer and shorter in duration. 

I also learned last time that as much as having carefully gone through all of the preparatory material and prior lessons equips you with the core knowledge necessary to complete the project, completely starting a project from scratch is an entirely different monster. Having completed a project like that before definitely boosted my confidence and from the outset, I felt more capable of completing this project than I did throughout the entirety of the last one. 


To help make the project seem less daunting I maintained my theme from the first project, where I designed a CLI gem to retrieve information from the website of Penn's student newspaper, and designed a basic web app to organize a student's course-load. I think I will try to stick with this theme for as many of the projects as I can. It's fun and helps me think more dynamically about my needs as a student. Also, thinking of ideas for students is easy when you're still a student like I am.

After completing this project, I certainly feel like I am well on my way to becoming a full-stack web developer!

I am proud of the product I created. So check out my [Sinatra App](https://github.com/andyjoshowitz/sinatra-course-list-app). 

Can't wait to see what Learn has in store for me next!
