I loved learning HTML5. That's why I was surprised when I heard that many students actually find the units on HTML and CSS to be closer to the boring end of the course. Having come from a non-coding background, I found myself more capable of appreciating HTML5 and website creation than the early units on ruby. 

As we all know, HTML5 is the standard markup language for web development today. You have to learn the elements of each separate browser in order to optimize your coding on that specific browser. What is interesting about HTML5 is that is not exactly a stand alone kind of operation. The full extent of its powers are beautified with the enhacements of other languages, namely css and javascript. While I have not yet dabbled in Javacsript, I found that the fusion of HTML and CSS created challenges for me when learning HTML. Of course, this is something I will have to get used to. As I progress further into the program I am realizing more and more the need to use sibling languages together to write the best (most advanced and powerful code). 

A challenge? Yes. But in order to be a good programmer I am not only going to have to overcome it, I will have to learn to excel at it.
