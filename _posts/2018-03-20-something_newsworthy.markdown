Ever felt simultaneously like you know so much and yet also so little? I felt that way when embarking upon my first project while enrolled at the Flatiron School. Sure I had gone through all of the previous material (units, modules, lessons, labs etc.) and tried my best to learn it all well. Like a little kid learning how to swim, however, there's only so much wading around in the shallow water of the kiddie pool can accomplish. It often takes being thrown way into the deep end to really learn how to swim. That was certainly true of my experience completing this project. Yes, I definitely knew the concepts. But as anyone who can remember learning how to swim, ride a bike, ice skate, or speak a new language can attest, there's something about truly being left to your own devices that forces you to really master a trade.

How did I complete the project? I took baby-steps. 

To help make the project seem less daunting I decided to scrape information from the website of The Daily Pennsylvanian, the undergraduate student newspaper at UPenn, where I, for the next few weeks, am still a student. Using this as the base for my project had the added bonus of keeping me informed and up-to-date on campus happenings. I think it's safe to say that in addition to having mastered the art of scraping from websites, I have become the master of Penn gossip circles.

From there, I had no idea where to go. So, as per the advice given in some of the videos offered as guidance for the project, I began to map out my CLI class.  Major takeaway from this project, if someone offers help, take it! I took advantage of everything they offered. From there, as had been promised in the video, things fell right into place, albeit slowly.

I can't emphasize enough that "albeit slowly" point. The number of commits to my repository will attest to the amount of back-and-forth and trial-and-error I underwent before arriving at the final product. 

All of my toils and headaches were well worth it, though. There's nothing like the feeling you get when finally arriving at the solution to any head-scratcher, of which there were many! 

I am proud of the product I created. So check out my [Daily Pennsylvanian CLI Gem](https://github.com/andyjoshowitz/daily-pennsylvanian-cli-app). It is truly newsworthy.
