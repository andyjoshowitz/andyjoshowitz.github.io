Rails is supposed to make the programmer's life much easier. But before it gets easy, it's really tough. My firt Rails project proved quite a challenge. Rails is created to help us, but thats not automatic. A programmer has to understand it and learn how to use its methods (etc.) before it can be of use. I learned this the hard way for this project. 

A recent college grad, student-related topics are constantly on my mind. This past semester, my last in college, I spent a lot of time reflecting on my time in college. I thought a lot about my favorite courses, and a good deal about my least favorite. Every student is asked to fill out a review on each course they complete prior to viewing their grade from tehe course. I know from this experience how cathartic writing a scathing review of a bad class can be. So for this project I created a course-review site. Users can add new courses which other users can review!

I dont think I understand Rails well when I began this project. As a result, the project took much longer to complete. All in all, I learned quite a lot.
